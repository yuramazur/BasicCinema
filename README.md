# BasicCinema
This project is basic interface for creating Cinemas, adding films and managing seances.
Input is implemented through console (Main.java). 
User input is checked for validity considering type of data is being added, for example starting time of seance, movie duration, etc.
If user input is incorrect, app will warn user with type of error, for example if two movies seances intersect with each other.
User can create new cinemas, save them to file or open already existing.
